# Real Estate Feature Engineering Project

This is a project regarding Real Estate prices. The goal is to take a specific dataset, examine the features, and determine what prospective homebuyers care the most about.

Here is an example output image. Notice how the Sale price of a home is clustered around $175,000. Further, the overall quality hovers around 6 on the 0-10 scale.

The above-ground living square area (GrLivArea) has a mean of roughly 1500 square feet. The average number of cars that a garage can contain is 1.5. Obviously, cars are whole numbers, so it is safe to say that most garages hold either one car or two cars.

The mean first floor area is just over 1000 square feet. Most homes have either 1 or 2 bathrooms.

Many homes in this dataset were built between 1950 and 2000, with the average year built around 1975.
